# Dataset Summary and Analysis Report

## Dataset Overview
The dataset comprises **2652 rows** and **8 columns**, capturing various attributes associated with ratings of movies or content. The columns are as follows:

- **date**: The date of the entry (with some missing values)
- **language**: Language of the content
- **type**: Type of entry (e.g., movie)
- **title**: Title of the content
- **by**: Creator or contributor
- **overall**: Overall rating (integer scale)
- **quality**: Quality rating (integer scale)
- **repeatability**: Repeatability rating (integer scale)

### Missing Values
- The `date` column has **99 missing values** (~3.7% of the dataset).
- The `by` column has **262 missing values** (~9.9% of the dataset).
- All other columns have no missing values, indicating generally good data integrity.

### Categorical Data Insights
- **Language**: 11 unique languages present, with **English** being predominant (1306 entries).
- **Type**: The dataset is heavily skewed towards **movies**, with **2211 entries** classified as such.
- **Title**: A diverse range of content with **2312 unique titles**.
- **By**: Significant contributor diversity, but with many missing entries.

### Numerical Data Insights
- **Overall Ratings**: Mean = 3.05, max = 5, min = 1—suggesting a slightly positive bias.
- **Quality Ratings**: Mean = 3.21, showing general satisfaction.
- **Repeatability Ratings**: Mean = 1.49, a strong indication that many entries lack repeatable assessments.

### Statistical Distribution
Ratings are predominantly gathered around the midpoints (3 for both overall and quality ratings), indicating a close clustering around average values with some outliers.

## Analysis Performed
We performed several analyses to extract meaningful insights from the data:

1. **Missing Values Analysis**: Examined the implications of missing values in the `date` and `by` columns.
2. **Categorical Data Engagement**: Analyzed frequency distributions for categorical columns.
3. **Statistical Summaries**: Compiled summary statistics for numerical columns.
4. **Visual Insights**: Generated visualizations including:
   - **Correlation Heatmap**: To explore relationships between numeric features.
   - **Outlier Detection**: Identified potential outliers in the dataset.
   - **Pair Plot Analysis**: Visualized pairwise relationships in the dataset for numeric features.

## Key Findings
1. **Data Integrity**: Good completeness in non-categorical columns, though `date` and `by` require attention due to missing values.
2. **Dominance of Movies**: The overwhelming presence of movies suggests the need for broader representation of content types if generalizations are to be made.
3. **Rating Trends**: A concentration of ratings around the midpoint suggests general satisfaction but may indicate a lack of differentiability in ratings.
4. **Repeatability Concerns**: Low scores in repeatability suggest potential biases in assessments that may need addressing in future collections or analyses.

## Implications and Suggestions
- **Address Missing Data**: Investigate and remediate missing values in `date` and `by` columns, considering potential data imputation methods.
- **Enhance Rating Systems**: Explore ways to increase granularity in rating scales, particularly as clustering around 3 and 4 may lead to a lack of nuanced understanding of user preferences.
- **Expand Content Diversity**: If applicable, consider expanding entry types beyond movies to enhance dataset richness.
- **Future Data Capture**: Include features that can help clarify repeatability, ensuring comprehensive assessments in future datasets.
- **Clear Dataset Purpose**: Defining the dataset's purpose will ensure collection efforts are aligned and that analyses yield actionable insights.

This analysis positions the dataset to better inform further research or development based on its ratings and attributes, potentially guiding future enhancements and analyses in the domain of content evaluation.![correlation_heatmap.png](correlation_heatmap.png)
