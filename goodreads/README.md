# Dataset Summary

## Overview
The dataset comprises 10,000 entries (books) with 23 columns that provide a range of attributes related to the books, including IDs, authors, publication years, ratings, and more. 

## Key Insights

1. **Structure**: 
   - Contains 10,000 books with various attributes.

2. **Missing Values**:
   - Several columns exhibit significant missing values such as:
     - `isbn`: 700 missing
     - `isbn13`: 585 missing
     - `original_publication_year`: 21 missing
     - `original_title`: 585 missing
     - `language_code`: 1,084 missing

3. **Authors**:
   - A total of 4,664 unique authors. The most frequent author is "Stephen King" with 60 entries.

4. **Language Distribution**:
   - 8,916 books have language codes, with English (`eng`) being predominant at 6,341 occurrences. A notable number of entries lack language codes.

5. **Publication Year Range**:
   - Original publication years range from -1750 to 2017, suggesting potential issues or outlier values.

6. **Ratings Overview**:
   - The average book rating is approximately 4.00 with low variability (standard deviation ~0.25), indicating generally favorable reviews. 

7. **Popularity Metrics**:
   - Significant variation in reader engagement is shown by `ratings_count` (max: 4,780,653), `work_ratings_count`, and `work_text_reviews_count`.

8. **Books Count**:
   - On average, authors have about 76 books, with a maximum of 3,455, highlighting prolific authors.

9. **ISBN Data Missingness**:
   - Substantial missing values in ISBN and ISBN13 columns raise concerns for unique book identification.

10. **Images**:
    - 6,669 unique book cover images are present, with many default images indicating some entries lack cover images.

## Suggestions for Improvement

1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Address missing values, especially in critical columns (e.g., `isbn`, `isbn13`, `language_code`) through data enrichment.
   - Investigate outlier publication years to correct or remove as necessary.

2. **Standardization**:
   - Develop a coding scheme for missing values for clearer data interpretation.

3. **Enrichment**:
   - Consider integrating additional information (e.g., genre, detailed author info) to enhance analytical capabilities.

4. **Language Inference**:
   - Use known works to infer language codes for entries that lack them.

5. **Visualizations**:
   - Generate dashboards to reveal trends in publication years, ratings distributions, and author contributions.

6. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Explore correlations, such as between ratings and the number of publications.

7. **Documentation**:
   - Document data sources, quality issues, and transformations for reproducibility.
